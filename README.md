## App Description

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  Making plans for the weekend doesn't always have to be hard. No matter where you are, our WhatDo app will let you learn about all kinds of fun events near your location, from concerts and plays to sporting events and museums. Our app also gives you a brief weather report for your selected day, so you can decide for yourself if you'd rather spend the day inside or outside. Favorite events can be saved to your profile, so you can look up the details quickly.
